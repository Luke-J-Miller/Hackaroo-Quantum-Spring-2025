# Quantum-Enhanced Classification with Variational Quantum Circuits
Concept
- Build a variational quantum circuit (VQC) classifier (using qiskit.machine_learning or custom parameterized circuits) to distinguish between two or more classes in a dataset.
- Train the circuitâ€™s parameters with a hybrid quantum-classical loop (using gradient descent or another optimizer in Qiskit).


Dataset Adaptation

- Start with small/low-dimensional datasets (e.g., Iris, Wine, or Breast Cancer from scikit-learn).
- For a more advanced project, students can select a custom dataset (e.g., a subset of MNIST images or a text classification dataset).
- Emphasize how quantum feature maps can encode data into the quantum circuit.


Potential Quantum Advantage

- Discuss how quantum feature spaces might offer better class separability.
- Show how the circuit scales with qubit number vs. classical approaches. Even if near-term quantum hardware is limited, highlight theoretical advantage or hybrid approaches that reduce parameter count.
