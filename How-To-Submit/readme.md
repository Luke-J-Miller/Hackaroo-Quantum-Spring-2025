# Submission Guidelines

## How to submit your poster for printing

*DEADLINE: April 1, 2025, 9:00 AM.*


1. Ensure that your document is either 24"x36" or 36"x42" in landscape orientation. The [examples](https://github.com/Luke-J-Miller/Hackaroo-Quantum-Spring-2025/tree/main/How-To-Submit/Examples) and [template](https://github.com/Luke-J-Miller/Hackaroo-Quantum-Spring-2025/blob/main/How-To-Submit/Poster%20Template_42W%20x%2036H_SSE.pptx) are 36"x42".
2. Fill out the [Poster Order Form](https://github.com/Luke-J-Miller/Hackaroo-Quantum-Spring-2025/blob/main/How-To-Submit/SSE%20Poster%20Print%20Order%20Form.pdf)
3. In previous years, posters were sent directly for printing. *DO NOT EMAIL* your poster. Instead, go to [FIXME: Box link](google.com), and upload your form and poster.
4. Before sending, ensure that posters:
   + Meet the size requirements above.
   + Are saved as either pptx or pdf
   + You have filled out the order form and attached it as well.
   + Only send one poster file per email.  SSE students receive one free printing, but additional printings may cost extra.
