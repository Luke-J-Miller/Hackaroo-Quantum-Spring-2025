# Submission Guidelines

## How to submit your poster for printing

*DEADLINE: April 1, 2025, 9:00 AM.*


1. Ensure that your document is either 24"x36" or 36"x42" in landscape orientation. The examples and template are 36"x42".
2. In previous years, posters were sent directly for printing. *DO NOT EMAIL* your poster. Instead, go to [FIXME: Box link](google.com), and upload your form and poster.
3. Before sending, ensure that posters:
   + Meet the size requirements above.
   + Are saved as either pptx or pdf
   + You have filled out the order form and attached it as well.
   + Only send one poster file per email.  SSE students receive one free printing, but additional printings may cost extra.
1. Posters must be sent as either a PowerPoint (pptx) or PDF file via email to [UMKCSSEposterjobs@umkc.edu](UMKCSSEposterjobs@umkc.edu).
